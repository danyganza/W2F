Pascal Siakam was born in Africa, but he didn't start playing basketball until he was a teenager. Like most
        African children, he first played soccer before being invited to a clinic for basketball (Basketball without
        Boarders). 
       
        
        After that, he moved to America, where he attended a basketball prep school before catching a
        Division's attention! He participated in Division 1 basketball and was selected by The Raptors, the only NBA
        team in Canada.
